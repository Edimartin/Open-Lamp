Thanks for download the openLamp source code.

OpenLamp is a piece of software where can generate a normal map from ilumination images.
Unfortunately the source code dont have a Makefile but you can create a project in your
favorite IDE and compile the project yourself.

To compile this project you will need download and install the SFML library
from https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/#getting-started.

The use of the software is very simple.
Click the mouse left button inside the rectangles to load the image, and press the right button to remove it.
If you click the mouse left button inside the normal map rectangle, you will save the normal map image.
You can save the image as .jpg and .png file.

In the future I will add new features to this software.

Thanks.
